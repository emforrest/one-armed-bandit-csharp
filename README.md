# one-armed-bandit-csharp

<h2>The one armed bandit problem from the end of year 11, but this time in C# and actually using object oriented programming</h2>

As transition work between year 11 and year 12 Computer Science I was asked to create a program simulating a One-Armed Bandit. I initially created this program in Python as that is the only language I knew at the time, and was what I would be using going into A-Level Computer Science. 

Recently I have been wanting to learn the basics of C#, and I decided that it would be fun to revisit this project and recreate it in C#. An option for the original project was to include classes and other OOP principles that we had just learnt, however being pressed for time I omitted these features in my Python version. So this time I am going to make OOP the fundamental paradigm of the project. This should be good preparation for my Object-Oriented Programming degree module in the new term.
